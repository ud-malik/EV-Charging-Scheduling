This project includes the research on Optimziation of EV Charging Scheduling.
It contains four files i.e. Islamabad Map that was used as case study, code to create a transportational model to simulate real road network od Islamabad Pakistan, Genetic Algorithm code to optimize the charging scheduling, code with real world scenarios of non-linear battery charging and power interruptions.
